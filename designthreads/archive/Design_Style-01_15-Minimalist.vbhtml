<p>Influenced strongly by the Japanese 'Feng Sui', minimalist interiors are the epitome of sophisticated simplicity. Focused on the quality, rather than the quantity, these spaces rely heavily on the integrity of each piece within them. The concept of utter simplicity may seem cold and lackluster, however minimalist designs are meant to be restful and soothing. Their purposeful lack of ornamentation and decor allow the space to speak for itself. </p>		
<p>One of the key factors in minimalist interiors is open space, but it can appear cold and unwelcoming if not properly contained. Alleviate the hollow feeling vast empty spaces can create by utilizing repetition. Uniform repetition adds substance without creating visual clutter. Following with the concept of repetition, minimalist interiors maintain a singular color throughout the home. This continuity of color blends each space seamlessly into the next, creating the visual openness that is so important in these designs. Choosing a neutral wall color, rather than white, helps bring warmth into the home. While white may be predominant, it can come across as stark if not accented appropriately. Implementing a bold accent color though requires restraint. They can easily overwhelm the serenity minimalist spaces should evoke. Small doses scattered throughout will add emphasis without being obtrusive. Similarly patterns of any kind must also be handled carefully. Their nature is to attract attention and in minimalist interiors the attention is given to the space rather than what is in it. Subtle, tone on tone patterns are best suited for these designs and should remain as neutral in color as the room allows. Substituting texture for pattern is another easy way to add visual interest. Coordinated textures used sparingly can give the design depth. From sleek surfaces to raw edges, textures bring a humanizing effect, making the space feel friendly and livable.</p>

<p>Minimalist interiors thrive on basic simplicity. The coordination between minimal but functional is crucial. Making up a large part of its composition are the furnishings featured within. These must be able to multi-task while remaining less complex in design. However comfort is still a priority; to achieve a clean look opt for fitted and tailored furnishings, especially those that are cushioned. Utilizing clean, flowing lines throughout helps to create that sense of spaciousness minimalist interiors are known for. Purity in design is essential, as each design element must have the integrity to stand alone. Investing in quality furnishings allows the design to come together more naturally. Restraint must be used though when it comes to mixing furnishing styles. Choosing a classic style such as a Windsor chair will add a timeless essence to the design, but bringing more than one piece of such stature will end up creating confusion rather than cohesion.</p>

<p>As with any interior design, details make the difference between an ordinary space and an extraordinary one. Minimalist interiors are so striking because of their lack of extraneous clutter. Everything has a rightful place, which contributes to their clean environments. A lack of excess keeps these interiors streamlined and spacious. However, the extremity of this design may also lend it a cold, uninviting aura. Bring life into the space by allowing certain elements to become a focal point. These small personalized touches contribute an individual sense of style without overpowering the design.</p>

<p>Design is a truly personal matter and when it comes to a home, it becomes our escape. Minimalist interiors have a zen-like and peaceful quality but yet remain poised and sophisticated. It is the union of these two uniquely individual traits that defines these interiors so distinctly. </p>
