<p>Timeless and somewhat trendy, transitional design merges deep-rooted history with modern concepts. Consider them traditional without the defined heaviness and contemporary with a hearty helping of history. Transitional interiors invite you in by utilizing the simplicity of organic lines, neutral color tones, and the incorporation of light and warmth. The marriage of unique characteristics from both traditional and contemporary designs is what makes transitional interiors an elegant, enduring design style. </p>

<p>As with any design, the furniture within it sets the tone. Exuding an unassuming, refined style transitional interiors can be found to have Asian, Shaker, or even Mission-style furnishings due to their simple design characteristics. Aged, well crafted pieces add a richness to the space with their soft, sweeping curves while the smooth, clean lines of more modern furnishings keeps the design profile simple yet sophisticated. Furniture is typically moderately sized as transitional interiors are about a sense of relaxed coordination and not an oversized attitude. The perfect balance of femininity with masculinity within transitional designs allows for a comfortable style for all.  </p>

<p>To evoke a clean, serene atmosphere transitional interiors rely on a neutral palette. Subtle natural tones are combined with restful darks to create a balanced design. Warmer shades of white such as vanilla, ivory, and tan are a few favorite foundations for the color palette while deep nautical blues, charcoals, and woody browns add depth and build character. Enhancing the color scheme is the coordination of color between paint and textiles. Solid, textured fabrics aid in the sense of comfort found in the transitional interiors color palette. Occasionally though, graphic patterns are utilized to help break the monotony within a space. Texture also plays a large roll as it contributes interest without overpowering the design. A key element in transitional interiors is to continue the color scheme throughout the home in order to allow for a harmonious, natural flow from one space to another. </p>

<p>Other design elements such as window treatments, flooring, and decor are also important factors in a transitional design. Windows are most often  covered with modest, solid-colored drapes allowing for a clean, simplistic look. Roman shades or textured woven blinds are also common as they too supply a sophisticated concept without detracting from the overall design. Similarly, flooring is generally a natural wood or neutral-toned carpet. Ranging from rich mahogany to warm oak, the wooden flooring adds an incredible amount of character to the transitional interior. When carpet or a rug is chosen, texture is very important so styles such as berber, sisal, or even an animal hide are common selections. Continuing with the natural elements, countertops throughout the home are typically seen to be any variation of stone or wood. From granite to soapstone, these natural counters add a natural elegance to the space. While wood is less common as a counter, tables and furnishings are almost always made from a hearty wood. Last, but not least, decor is usually at a minimum. Artwork is displayed in an understated way in basic, matted frames while signature pieces are showcased without much fanfare. Decor is usually unassuming in nature and minimal by choice. The design of a transitional interior is done so that the focus is on its simplicity and sophistication. </p>
